# raylib nightly wasm
This repo simply uses github actions to grab the current master branch from [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), compile it to wasm, and publish the resulting file to github pages: https://michaelfiber.github.io/raylib-nightly-wasm/libraylib.a.gz

This is part of an effort to make WASM builds of raylib based projects faster while still being close to the HEAD of the raylib repo.
